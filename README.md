## Usage

### Config
The config file located at `env/config.js` contains environment variables that can be set to your requirements and `process.env.NODE_ENV` will be used to determine which set of variables will be used.
Find more information in the [API Documentation](APIDOCS.md).

### Server
The server is in NodeJS and is configured to start with `node server/server.js` or simply `npm start` from the root directory.

### Client

### API Keys and public DB_URI

The Google geocoding API-key and the public Mongo-lab URI are all stored in `.env`, which is `.gitignore`d.
The variables in `.env` can be manually added to the production server with `$ heroku config`. To access the the `.env` file with `process.env` in development mode, you must start the development server with `$ heroku local`.
