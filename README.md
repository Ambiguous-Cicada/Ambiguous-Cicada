My two greatest technical strengths are:
1) frontend organization such as organizing models and views to work together using bb or configuring a model-factory-controller set up in angular
2) visualizeing big picture relationships in a full stack and seting up request logic between front to back

My two greatest technical weaknesses are:
1) Understanding other peoples code and efficiently knowing where to pick it up at and in what direction to go. I'm slow in that respect.
2) Debugging code especially that of asyncronous nature is difficult for me as well

Personal Goals
1) to improve upon my weaknesses
2) Learn how to build better visualizations as I don't know much on that end.
3) have more of a nack for figuring out more efficient routes quickly
4) be a supportive and easy person to work with
